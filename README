NAME
    Snowflake - Wrapper for the Pygments command line tool, pygmentize.

SYNOPSIS
        use Snowflake;
        my $syntaxer = Snowflake->new( '/some/file.pl', 'perl' );
        print $syntaxer->colorize;

DESCRIPTION
    *Snowflake* is a port of (the Ruby package) *Albino* to Perl; like that
    package, it requires the pygmentize command-line tool.

    Assumes pygmentize is in the path. If not, set its location with
    "$Snowflake::Bin = '/path/to/pygmentize'".

    This'll print out an HTMLized, Perl-highlighted version of
    /some/file.pl.

        my $syntaxer = Snowflake->new( '/some/file.pl', 'perl' );
        print $syntaxer->colorize;

    To use another formatter, pass it as the third argument:

        my $syntaxer = Snowflake->new( '/some/file.pl', 'ruby', 'bbcode' );
        print $syntaxer->colorize;

    You can also use the colorize class method:

        print Snowflake->colorize( '/some/file.pl', 'perl' );

    Stringification is also overloaded on *Snowflake* objects, for nicer use
    in templates. For example:

        sub pretty_print {
            return Snowflake->new( \shift, 'perl' );
        }

    The default lexer is "text". You need to specify a lexer yourself;
    because we are using STDIN there is no auto-detect.

    To see all lexers and formatters available, run "pygmentize -L".
